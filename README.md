How CheckIT works:
CheckIT is a simple plagiarism detector that uses two string matching algorithms: brute-force using hamming distance and Rabin-Karp. CheckIT works by checking four files uploaded by the user from their device: the file suspected of plagiarism and 3 corpus documents (file where the suspected document may be plagiarized from). 

Following are the steps to using CheckIT:
Click on the button labeled “Corpus 1” and choose one of the corpus files from your device. 
Click on the button labeled “Corpus 2” and choose one of the corpus files from your device. 
Click on the button labeled “Corpus 3” and choose one of the corpus files from your device. 
After this, CheckIT automatically saves your files and will wait for the input of the suspected file.
Click on the button labeled “Suspected” and choose the suspected file from your device. 
Finally, click the button labeled “Start” and CheckIT will perform hundreds of string matching comparisons using brute-force using hamming distance and Rabn-Karp to determine plagiarism. 
Then your suspected document will be displayed along in two places on screen.
On the right are the sections of the suspected deemed to be plagiarized by the Rabin-Karp algorithm and on the left are the sections of the suspected deemed to be plagiarized by brute-force using hamming distance.
Finally, a similarity percentage will be calculated and shown on screen along with the final decision by CheckIT.
